# Py Gyver
Help Mac Gyver to escape his prison! 

To play the game:
- Create a virtual environment in Python 3
- Run *requirements.txt* to install the required libraries
- Run *main.py*

Use the arrow keys to move, press ESC to close the program and R to restart the level. Pick every object before meeting the guardian of the prison to win: Otherwise, you'll be in huuuuge trouble.

Launch the game by adding the "terminal" argument to the command line for a bonus mode ;)
